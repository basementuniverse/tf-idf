  `To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;`,

  `This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.`,

  `Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.`,

  `Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
excessive grief the enemy to the living.`,

  `Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech.`,

  `There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.`,

  `Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.`,

  `Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.`,

  `My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.`,

  `Young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.`,

  `By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke`,

  `Ay me, for aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth,
But either it was different in blood—`,

  `...be not afraid of greatness.
Some are born great, some achieve greatness,
and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.`,

  `Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.`,

  `We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.`,

  `Our doubts are traitors,
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt.`,
